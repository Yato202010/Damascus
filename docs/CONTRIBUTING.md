## How to contribute to Damascus

#### **Did you find a bug?**
  
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Yato202010/Damascus/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Yato202010/Damascus/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?                                                                     

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the [Coding Style Doc](https://github.com/Yato202010/Damascus/tree/main/docs/CODE.md) guide to know more about coding conventions.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Damascus will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Discussion Tab](https://github.com/Yato202010/Damascus/discussions/new?category=ideas) and start writing code.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
