      # NOTE :
      # allow-branch HEAD is because GitHub actions switches
      # to the tag while building, which is a detached head.
      # We *could* pass through `--no-verify` so `cargo` doesn't build the crate before publishing,
      # which is reasonable, since this job only runs after the Linux, Windows, and WASM builds
      # have passed.
